# Minimum Keyword Set Recommendation

We are interested in finding keywords to uniquely identify a document of interest among others. Given a keyword search engine, a set of documents and a document of interest, our algorithm returns a set of keywords such that they would rank the document of interest top-K in the search engine. As a demonstration, we implemented the algorithm and tested the performance with different information retrieval models.
